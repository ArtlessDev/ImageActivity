# ImageActivity

This is Assignment #4 the project is to have a recycler view of images and then 
when one of the images is clicked, it is shown on a larger imageView. this project 
was especially tough with just the issue of getting the images into both the recycler
view and the imageview. i really enjoyed the realization of how objects work more and 
whatnot. this project was definitely a help to understanding kotlin and android 
development more.
